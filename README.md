A movie recommendation system is a tool that suggests films you might enjoy based on your preferences. When you enter the name of a movie you like, the system analyzes its features—such as genre, director, actors, and user ratings—and recommends five similar movies. This personalized approach helps users discover new films that match their tastes, enhancing their viewing experience.
